# FooFarm Server is back

It's a different mod pack than we used to run.   We don't use an 
installer this time.  At some point we might apply to put the pack into a wide-distribution
system (like CurseForge), but there's no need until the user base grows.  

## About the mod pack

The mod-pack is a medium sized pack.  It is not very large; there are
not an excessive number of mods.  It should not be a terrible 
burden on your system.


The mod list:

* AppleCore
* Baubles
* BiomeTweaker
* BiomesOPlenty
* BloodArsenal
* BloodMagic
* Chisel
* CoralReef
* CraftingTweaks
* EconomyLite
* HungerOverhaul
* MCTSmelteryIO
* MagicBees
* Mantle
* MysticalAgradditions
* MysticalAgriculture
* Reliquary
* TConstruct
* Thaumcraft
* Bloodtinker
* Buildcraft
* Deadly World
* DefiledLands
* Forestry
* Natura
* Pyrotech
* Twilight Forest


### Administrative Mods/Plugins

* LuckPerms
* Nucleus
* Grief Prevention
* SpongeForge
* Worldedit


## About the Server

* It's a claim based world.  Use claims to protect your stuff.
* We haven't yet established a "Spawn point" of significance.  Do we need to?
* The mods in the game are chosen to make the game more challenging than plain Vanilla
Minecraft.  
* The events that might cause us to wipe the world would be an important update to the 
pack that requires it, or finding a bug in some mod-interactions that make the mod pack unusable. 
In general, we run it until it breaks.

### Administration
There are four main roles on the server.


* **Janitor** - can do just about anything
* **Admin** - can do almost anything
* **Mod** - can do a lot to keep the Players happy.
* **Player** - <b>you are the core.</b> Without you, there is no game.

In between **Admin** and **Janitor** is a special role **Tech.**  We give **Tech** to the 
members who are talented and experienced both in handling the game and also
creating structures that help Players.

**Tech** have WorldEdit privileges. For those in the staff (**Mod+**) who just like to build for
the server, that's where they are -- Tech's.

We don't accept donations. We don't ask for donations.  If anyone tries to ask you for
a donation, let us know and we'll deal with it.  It's not part of the game, at least not our
game.

We're likely NOT going to setup a web-based forum system.  They are just a lot of trouble
to maintain and there's a lot easier/fun ways to engage with players -- 
[Discord](https://discord.gg/84Vz5jB4) and in the game itself.

### Simple How-To

* Play the game!  Have fun with it!
* If you get stuck, have questions, issues, ideas - tell a Mod.
* No Mod online?  Ask for help on <a href="https://discord.gg/84Vz5jB4">Discord</a>.
